# Ensemble Model for Credit Risk Prediction

An ensemble machine learning model for predicting credit risk using various algorithms.

## Overview

This repository contains an ensemble model that combines the predictions of multiple machine learning algorithms to predict credit risk. The ensemble model is created using the VotingClassifier technique, where each individual algorithm provides its prediction, and the final prediction is determined by majority voting.

## Algorithms Used

The ensemble model combines the following machine learning algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine
- Neural Network
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

## Usage

To use the ensemble model for credit risk prediction:

1. Prepare your dataset and features for prediction.
2. Initialize each individual algorithm with appropriate hyperparameters.
3. Train each algorithm on your dataset.
4. Create the ensemble model using the VotingClassifier.
5. Predict credit risk using the ensemble model.

## Example Usage

```python
# Initialize and train individual classifiers
logreg = LogisticRegression()
dtree = DecisionTreeClassifier()
# ... (initialize other classifiers)

# Create the ensemble model using VotingClassifier
ensemble = VotingClassifier(estimators=[
    ('logreg', logreg),
    ('dtree', dtree),
    # ... (other classifiers)
], voting='hard')

# Train the ensemble model
ensemble.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict using the ensemble model
ensemble_predictions = ensemble.predict(X_test)
```

## Evaluation

You can evaluate the performance of the ensemble model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Adjust the `voting` parameter (e.g., 'hard' or 'soft') based on your specific needs.
